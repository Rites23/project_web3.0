Krypt - Web 3.0 Blockchain Application

Using Web 3.0 methodologies, Solidity and Metamask I built my first real Web 3.0 Application - from start to finish.

I connected a regular React.js application to the blockchain and paired it to my Ethereum wallet using MetaMask.

I also learnt how to write Smart Contracts on the Ethereum network using the #Solidity programming language.
